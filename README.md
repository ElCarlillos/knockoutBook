# knockoutBook
This is a simple practice project that aims to be a copy of one of the most popular social network Facebook

Overview
This project was created on Laravel, a PHP frameworks that organizes files to follow the MVC pattern, this pattern manage the project files into three main fields, Model, View and Controller
I´m using laravel for backend and frontend, (with the blade template generator), and a MySQL database managed by Phpmyadmin


Progress
1. Home page, (i´m not naming the register and login pages, because, thanks to laravel, you can automatically generate an authentication scaffolding).
  This view features a responsive navbar containing a dropdown menu with the user name and a Logout and Profile options
  
  a. Profile view:
    in this view we have the profile user´s picture, an three diferent buttons that allow you to "follow" the user and start a 
    messenger session, (this button it´s not functional by now).
    
    After that i simulated the information, photos and friends menu below the profile picture.
    
    And that´s it by now.
